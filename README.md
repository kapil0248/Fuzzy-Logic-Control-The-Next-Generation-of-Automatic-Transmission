# Fuzzy-Logic-Control-The-Next-Generation-of-Automatic-Transmission
his project aims to develop an intelligent automatic transmission system using Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) in MATLAB. Unlike traditional rule-based or PID controllers, the fuzzy logic approach mimics human decision-making to achieve smoother gear transitions and enhanced driving performance.
